Years before hip-hop would become a "huge thing", performer Earl Tucker(1905-1937) created a new type of dance move in the mid 1920. He used floats and slides to invent new dance moves, and the dances were the inspiration by breakdancing. Fast forward 20 years, a technology, performer Thosmas Wong had used a speaker to creat a booming sound. The people had loved it and wanted more. In the 1960s, James Brown Band were a hit and got called on a Live show called The Apollo. The band caught so much attention. James Brown made the hip-hop movement huger than in was in the 20s.

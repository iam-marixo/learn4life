  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
  My name is Marisol Odallys Garcia. I'm a 17 year old amatuer programmer. I'm born and raised in Fresno, California. I've been coding for a maximum of 7 months and it was a hard learning experience for me for someone who never heard of this "coding world.. HTML.. CSS". Although the endless nights trying to pratice for class the next morning so I don't look like a fool in front of my peers are paying off. I can actually have a conversation with people who love to talk code. I can talk about what I do in class. It makes me more confident and pushing myself to keep going to class and one day accomplished of making a popular website that has my name all over it.
